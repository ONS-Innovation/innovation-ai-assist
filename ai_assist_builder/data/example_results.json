However, the job description of \"feeding and watering crops\" could also be consistent with some livestock farming activities. Therefore, the most likely SIC code is 01500 (Mixed farming), with a likelihood of 0.9. The SIC code 01610 (Support activities for crop production) is also a possibility, with a likelihood of 0.8. To confirm the most accurate SIC code, it is necessary to ask the respondent if the farm raises any livestock.",
