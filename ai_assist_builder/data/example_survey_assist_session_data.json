The job title 'Checkout operator' and job description 'I scan shopping, take cash and handle customer queries' further support this classification. However, there are other possible SIC codes that could be considered, such as 47290 'Other retail sale of food in specialised stores' or 47810 'Retail sale via stalls and markets of food, beverages and tobacco products'. To determine the most accurate SIC code, it is important to know if the supermarket is part of a larger chain or an independent store.",
