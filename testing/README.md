# Automating the Testing of the AI Assist tool.

You need to have an email and password. Export them as environment variables.

```bash
export EMAIL=your_email@example.com
export PASSWORD=your_password
```

You need to install the test dependencies using this command:

```bash
make install-test
```

Change directory into the testing folder:

```bash
cd testing
```

Add your CSV in the correct format to `testData.csv`.

If you would like the script to run in human like delay mode, change the following in your config.json file:

```json
{
    "human_like_delay": true
}
```

If not, you can leave the file as it is.

Run the script:

```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

Select the option to login and run the survey together.

```console
============================
        
1. Login and Run Survey Together
2. Exit

Enter your choice (1-2): 1
```

The script runs as a headless browser so no browser window will open. This is to improve speed and reduce user interference that can cause delays.

A log will build as you run the script in automation.log incase of any errors.

At two points, you will have to manually enter the answers to the questions as they are dynamic questions generated by the AI tool.

The text highlighted in yellow is important information that can help you answer the question.

The questions hightlighted in green are the questions you have to answer.

The script then handles everything else and saves to a new file in the `testedData.csv` file.
